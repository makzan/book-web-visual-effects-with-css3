# Latest Version Update

Version 0.1—Finalizing the chapter headings
In this version, I focus on adding chapter headings to finalize the content structure.

## What’s expected in next update ?

In next version, I fill in the content and code example links into the book. Then, I can work on each code example and write the explanation and variant usage discussions.
