## Drawing triangle

**The triangle is done via `border-color`.**

The size of the triangle depends on the `border-width`. The direction of the triangle depends on which side of the border has color while the others has transparent.

### Code snippets

The follow code snippet creates a triangle.

```
.demo {
  width: 0;
  height: 0;
  border: 30px solid transparent;
  border-bottom-color: gold;
}
```

The following screenshot shows the result:

### How it work

This is a trick on the borders.  We can define different colors for each border.

1. We make a normal element with border.
2. We set different colors to each border.
3. We get rid of the width and height.
4. We make 3 of the borders transparent.

If we want different direction of the triangle, we can simply set different border to be filled and keep the rest of the borders transparent.

### Chat bubble

```
<div class="chat-bubble">
  Hello, how are you?
</div>
```

CSS

```
.chat-bubble {
  margin-bottom: 10px;
  background: gold;
  padding: 10px;
  position: relative;
  border-radius: 5px;
}
.chat-bubble:after {
  content:'';
  
  position: absolute;
  right: 30px;
  bottom: -20px;
  
  width: 0px;
  height: 0px;
  border: 10px solid transparent;
  border-top-color: gold;
}
```

Please note that the pseudo element must have the `content` to be rendered by browser. So if we don’t need any content, we still need to set the `content:''` to empty.
